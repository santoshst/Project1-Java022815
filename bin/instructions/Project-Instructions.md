#Project 1
##5 Problems from Project Euler

For this weekly assignment, you will be working through a set of progressively more difficult problems from Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net).
Each problem will build upon one of the concepts covered in class. Collaboration is encouraged, and full understanding of the underlying concepts is required.

These problems will not be formally graded, but you might be asked to share your solutions with the class.

-------------


###Name Scores of an alphabetized list

Use the `names.txt` file, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names found in the `resources` directory. 

**Part 1:**Begin by sorting the list into alphabetical order. Save this new file as `p1aNames.txt` in the `answers` directory.

**Part 2:** Using `p1aNames.txt`, take the alphabetical value for each name, and multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714.
Save the list of all name scores as `p1bNames.txt`.

**Part 3:**What is the total of all the name scores in the file? Print out this total to the console in your `.java` file.

**Save your `.java` file in the `answers` directory as `p1.java`.**

###Large sums

Use the `longnums.txt` file in the `resources` directory for this problem.

**Part 1:** Build an array of the 100 numbers (each 50 digits long) contained in `longnum.txt`, and sort them according to size (smallest numbers first). Save this file as `p2a.txt` in the `answers` directory.

**Part 2:** Find the first 10 digits of the sum of all 100 numbers, and print the answer to the console.

**Save your `.java` file in the `answers` directory as `p2.java`.
